My summary of the btc whitepaper simplified payment verfication:

8. Simplified Payment Verification
###############################################################################################################################
===============================================================================================================================
p1. My Summary:

- it is possible to verify payments without running a full node
    - user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of longest proof-of-work chain
    - this can be got by querying network nodes until user has what they think is longest
    - then obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in
    - user cannot check the transaction for themself but can see that a network node has accepted it
        - this is done by linking it to a place in the chain
        - blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it
        
p1. My Comments:

again general understanding of concept but not the technical workings


===============================================================================================================================
p2. My Summary:

- the partial node verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network
     - but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker

- while partial nodes can verify transactions for themselves the simplified method can be fooled
    - by an attacker's favricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower network
    
- a strategy to protect against this is to accept alerts from other nodes
    - when they detect an invalid block it prompts user to download full block 
    - alerted transactions can be used to confirm the inconsistency
    - businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want full nodes
    - for more independent security and a quicker verification
