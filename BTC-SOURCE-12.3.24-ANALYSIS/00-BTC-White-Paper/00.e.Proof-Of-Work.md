My summary of the btc whitepaper proof of work summary:

4. Proof-Of-Work

===============================================================================================================================
p1. My Summary:

SN says to do a p2p distributed timestamp server you must have proof of work
- he cites Adam Back's Hashcash
- proof of work involves scanning for a value that when hashed ie w SHA-256 the hash begins with a number of zero bits
- the average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required but can be verified with a single hash


p1. My Comments:
- I don't really understand much of what is being talked about here
- this may be related to a Nonce which according to NIST is:

"A random or non-repeating value that is included in data exhanged by a protocol, usually for the purpose of guaranteeing the transmittal of live data rather than replayed data, thus detecing and protecting against replay attacks."
