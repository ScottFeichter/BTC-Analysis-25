The abstract is SN describing BTC in abstract summary.

My summary of the abstract:

- p2p ecash allows exchange w/o 3rd party

- p2p network w digital sig solves double spending problem

- transactions timestamped by hashing into ongoing pow chain to form unimpeachable record

- the longest chain proves:
        1. proof of sequence of events witnessed
        2. proof the longest chain came from the largest pool of cpu power

- while a majority cpu power controlled by nodes not cooperating in network attack:
        1. they will generate the longest chain
        2. they will outpace attackers

- network structure is minimal:
        1. messages are broadcast best effort
        2. nodes can leave or join at will
        3. new nodes accept the longest pow chain for the legit record of what happened prior to joining
