My summary of the btc whitepaper privacy:

###############################################################################################################################
10. Privacy
###############################################################################################################################
===============================================================================================================================
p1. My Summary:

- traditional banking achieves privacy by limiting access to information
- necessity to broadcast all transactions precludes this
- privacy can be had by breaking the flow of information in another place:
  - keeping public keys anonymous
  - public can see a tx but without information linking it to anyone
  - this is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges
  
p.1 My Comments:

- ok makes sense
- however, I wonder, when a public key no longer becomes anonymous can the owner get a new public key?
  - what is the process for "launderying" to a new public key?
  - is it possible for it to not be trackable?

===============================================================================================================================
p2. My Summary:

- an additional firewall is that a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner
- some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input tx that necessarily reveal their inputs
- the risk is if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other tx of same owner

p2. My Comments:

- ok so it looks like my concerns are valid
- have solutions been developed for this? if yes how much do they cost?
