My summary of the btc whitepaper incentive:

###############################################################################################################################
6. Incentive
###############################################################################################################################
===============================================================================================================================
p1. My Summary:

First transaction in a block is special:
    - it starts a new coin owned by creator of the block
    - this adds incentive for nodes
    - provides a way to initially distribute coins
    - the analogy is to gold miners
    - CPU capacity and electricity is what is expended

p1. My Comments:

I actually understand this woo hoo

===============================================================================================================================

p2. My Summary:

Transaction fees
    - this can also be an incentive
    - if the output value of a tx is less than the input value (?)
        - the difference is a transaction fee
        - it is added to the incentive value of the block containing the tx
    - when a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation the incentive is only tx fees
    - there will be no inflation
    
p2. My Comments:

Makes sense except I don't understand how the output value can be less than the input value

===============================================================================================================================

p3. My Summary:

Incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest
    - if a malicious majority attack occurs the bad actors would have to choose:
        1. steal back their payments
        2. generate new coins

"He ought tofind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."

p3. 

Ok I don't understand if this means the attacker should choose new coins and that will not hurt the system but will be fraud or if the bad action is not profitable...
