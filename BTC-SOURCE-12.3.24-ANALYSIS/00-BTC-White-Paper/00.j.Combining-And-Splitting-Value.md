My summary of the btc whitepaper simplified payment verfication:

###############################################################################################################################
8. Combining and Splitting Value
###############################################################################################################################
===============================================================================================================================
p1. My Summary:

- it would be unwieldy to make a separate tx for each sat in a tx
- tx contain multiple inputs and outputs to allow value to be split and combined
- usually there will be a single input from a larger previous transaction
    - could also be multiple inputs combining smaller amounts
- there can be at most two outputs
    - one for the payment
    - one for returning the change if any back to sender


p1. My Comments:

- ok makes sense
- wonder if there is a limit on inputs
- wonder how the bundling/splitting is done


===============================================================================================================================
p2. My Summary:

- fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those depend on many more, is not a problem according to SN
- "There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction's history."

p2. My Comments:

- hmmmm....there is no additional explanation provided why not it would be needed...this deserves some investigating
