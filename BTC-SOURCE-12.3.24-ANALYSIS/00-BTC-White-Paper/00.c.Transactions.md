p1. My Summary:

SN def of an electronic coin:
- a chain of digital signatures
- transfer of the coin is done by adding a new digital signature:
    - the owner "signs" a hash whose input consists of:
        - previous transaction
        - public key of new owner
- appears as though the hash output is what is signed by the owner
- I am not sure if the hash output is the sig or if there is a sig added to the output by owner...
- this seems like it may work in a similar way to title transfer
- these lines are added to the end of the coin
- a payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership

p1. My Comments:

- there is a diagram with the text but I don't quite understand it yet
================================================================================================================================

p2. My Summary:

SN says there is a problem of how to verify no double spend
- common solutions is to introduce a trusted central authority or mint for checking
- a coin could be returned to mint after each transaction and new coin issued
- only coins issued from the mint are trusted
- the problem with this is the mint/bank has control over everything

p2. My Comments:

- it seems as though with analogue money and physical transactions this is not a problem
- the problem then would merely be for a person to verify the authenticity of the coin ie is it pure gold of expected weight


================================================================================================================================

p3. My Summary:

- need a way that payee knows previous owners did not sign any earlier [most recent] transactions
    - the earliest [most recent] transaction is the important one for payee
    - payee doesn't care about later attempts to double-spend
    - only way to confirm absence of transaction is to be aware of all transactions
    - in the mint model the mint is aware of all and decides which arrived first
    - to do this without 3rd party:
        - all transactions must be publicly announced
        - must be a system for participants to agree on a single history
            - the history is the order in which transactions were received
            - payee needs proof at time of each transaction the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received

p3. My Comments:

- it sort of makes sense but is also seeming a bit half baked as it seems transactions would be wanting to happen continuosly at all times
- also what to make of off chain transactions...they seem very very risk prone...lightening?
